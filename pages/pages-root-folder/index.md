{% include alert info='What is the point of Elliptical DAO?' %}
Our goal is to build a community-owned and policy-controlled curation infrastructure that every participant can contribute and share the benefits from continuously value discovery.

Community artists not only create and distribute NFT artworks, but also need to grow together with the collectors of their works. By allowing all those involved in the collection of their artworks to share their success, artists thus build a closer bond of interest with the collectors.

Collectors, on the other hand, actively promote the awareness of the artists and their artworks so more and more people will discover and recognize the values of the artists and their artworks.

{% include alert info='How do I participate in Elliptical DAO?' %}
There are two main strategies for market participants: staking and trading. You can stake $EPT tokens (which is the utility token of the DAO) in return for more $EPT tokens and WETH rewards, and buy and sell NFTs minted by our Community artists in exchange for $EPT rewards.

Governance participants can get involved on our forum and through discussions on our community discord and DAO discord servers respectively. You need to own $vEPT token (which is the governance token of the DAO) to vote on the Elliptical DAO Improvement Proposals (EIPs). We are always looking for new community members to join and contribute!

{% include alert info='How can I benefit from Elliptical DAO?' %}
The protocol mints new $EPT tokens from staking and trading, the majority of which are distributed to the stakers and traders. The gain for stakers will come from their auto-compounding balances, though price exposure remains an important consideration. That is, if the increase in token balance outpaces the potential drop in price (due to inflation), stakers would make a profit.

The gain for traders comes from trading volume. Buyers and sellers will both receive token incentives for their contribution to the community through their value discovery.  

{% include alert info='Who runs Elliptical DAO?' %}
Rules and decisions are proposed by community members on the forum and accepted or rejected by token holders through snapshot voting.
