How to make more people discover and realize the value of their artworks is not an easy task for artists, especially if they want to promote their artworks in an unfamiliar market, for example, a market that the majority of collectors and investors speak different languages or have different culture.

Fortunately, network effect is an effective way to spread art and increase awareness of the artists, especially when the interests of the artists and their NFT artworks collectors and investors are bound, they are more willing to actively promote and spread the artist's artworks.  

*The Elliptical DAO* proposes a decentralized curation and growth sharing protocol, which is owned and managed by an open community, that connects artists, collectors, investors and fans of artists. In such a community, artists are willing to share the growing value of their artworks with their collectors, investors and fans. Fans, collectors and investors are also willing to do more dissemination for the artist, so that more people can discover the value of the artworks.


## Features of the Protocol
