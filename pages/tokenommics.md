### $EPT allocation

![Token Allocation]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/token-allocation.png)

The Elliptical community owns 85% of the total $EPT tokens. Others are reserved for private investors and the team. Details of the allocation are listed in the following table.

|&nbsp;         |Percentage of Supply|     Total $EPT      |Initial Circulation|
|:--------------|-------------------:|--------------------:|------------------:|
|Trading Rewards| 48.5% | 485,000,000 ||
|Strategic Sale | 5.0% |50,000,000||
|Airdrop | 5.0% | 50,000,000 | 50,000,000 |
|Liquidity Management| 2.0% | 20,000,000 |20,000,000|
|Staking Rewards   | 19.5% | 195,000,000 ||
|DAO Treasury   | 10.0% | 100,000,000 ||
|Team Treasury   | 10.0% | 100,000,000 ||

The $EPT token is distributed to the participants of the Elliptical DAO including:
- Stakers: $EPT token holders who deposit their $EPT that are auto-compounded at each user interaction.
- Traders: Buyers and sellers of the Elliptical DAO-curated NFTs receive rewards daily based on their trading volumes.
- Liquidity providers: those who provide liquidity can receive token rewards.  

Some $EPT tokens, part of the pre-minted tokens, are vested by strategic sale participants, the Team Treasury, and the DAO Treasury that also collect WETH based on the prorata of the $EPT tokens held in this contract.

Finally, other preminted tokens are airdropped to those who participate in the presale of the Elliptical DAO Membership NFTs and randomly selected users of the Opensea platform.

### $EPT emission schedule

- Tokens allocated for the DAO and the Team are emitted linearly for staking for about 307 days (or 2,000,000 block time). For every block time, 50 tokens are deposited into the staking pool. Staked tokens are available for withdrawal at the same speed after 180 days (or 1,170,000 block time) of staking.

- Tokens allocated for the Strategic Sale are emitted linearly for staking for about 307 days at a speed of 25 tokens per block time, and are available for withdrawal at the same speed after 180 days (or 1,170,000 block time) of staking.
