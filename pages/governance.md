The rules of the Elliptical DAO are established and deployed by a core team of community members through the use of smart contracts. These smart contracts formulate the operational framework of the DAO. These on-chain rules are highly visible, verifiable, and publicly auditable so any potential member can fully understand how the protocol is to function at every step.

> Governance requires significant coordination costs, however, arising from the need to have network participants involved in voting on every decision made. These coordination costs can be radically reduced in new types of decentralized networks, in which smart contracts enable participants to govern cooperatively.

Any community members have the ability to participate in the decision making process. For example, stakers may want to increase the rewarding percentage, or artists may want to have their artworks curated and listed on the market with a reduced curation service fee. However, no special authority can modify the rules of the DAO other than a consensus reached through voting. To enable a fair and open DAO governance, a governance token ($vEPT) is proposed and created in the DAO protocol.

A total number of 1 billion $vEPT tokens are issued, however, only stakers of $EPT token will receive corresponding governance tokens at a 1:1 basis. These governance tokens are bridged to the Polygon Chain where on-chain governance can take place without substantial transaction fees.
