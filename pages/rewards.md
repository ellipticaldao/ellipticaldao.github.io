The Elliptical DAO Membership NFT holders share the remaining 10% of the service fees collected from curation and trading. The reward ratio can be changed through the DAO Improvement Proposals."

The Elliptical DAO collects a basic curation fee of 7.5% (in $WETH) on all community curated NFT drops and a growth sharing fee of 2.5% (in $WETH) on all NFT sales. For example, if the community and an artist agree to curate, mint and drop NFTs, 10% of the trading price is given back to the community. If the NFT is sold on the secondary market, 2.5% of the trading price is given back to the community.

All the $WETH collected from these fees are consolidated at the end of each recurring 6,500 Ethereum block period (roughly 24 hours) and then 25% of the collected $WETH are distributed to $EPT stakers in a linear format per block over the next 6,500 block period, and the remaining are used to buy back $EPT for DAO reserve.

The ratio can be changed at the request of the community through a voting process.

- How often can I claim my WETH rewards?
: Any time you want. There’s no limit on the number of times you can claim your rewards each day, but just be cautious of the gas fees you are paying to claim.

- What happens if I forget to claim my WETH rewards for today?
: No need to worry. As long as your $EPT remain staked it will continue to accumulate even if you don’t claim every day. You can leave it until gas fees are low or you’ve accumulated enough to make it worth claiming.

- Active and Passive Staking
: The rewards for each day are calculated at the end of the previous period, then split between Active and Passive stakers before they're distributed.
> The main difference between Active and Passive stakers is that $EPT in passive staking do NOT earn additional $EPT while staked.

  : Active stakers are the majority of stakers, whose staked $EPT tokens are fully unlocked.

  : Passive stakers are stakers whose $EPT tokens are locked for trading but unlocked for staking: namely Team, Treasury and Strategic sale tokens.
